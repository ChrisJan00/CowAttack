Changes (by Iwan Gabovitch):
 - alien is a color-changed cultist
 - cow is a bit thinner and has longer legs
 - grass is color modified and a bit shorter
 - surface is a color-modified and 'rectanglified' sand ground tile
 - icons are mix-ups of above images
 - cowscout and cowmothership are 'enginered' cows fit for space and air travel
 - cowmothership2 is based on a building with a glass dome and cow's colors
